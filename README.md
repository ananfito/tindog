## Overivew

This is my solo project for [Module 7 of Scrimba's Front-End Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend). The requirements of the project include:
- Follow the design specfications (as indicated in [the provided Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/B5hR31XWekeVfpyXIzsGk7/Tinder-for-Dogs-(Copy)?node-id=0%3A1&t=Cus7T6CQ4Ufe6I2K-1 ))
- Use JavaScript classes
- Use modules (import/export)

## My Process

For this project I started by designing the main components of the site with the HTML and CSS. Once I had the site components setup, I started working with the JavaScript to add functionality. I added the following features in the following order: 
- Set up the JavaScript class
- Defined the render function 
- Created a function to get new avatars
- Added event listeners for the buttons
- Created functions for the event listeners
- Create a function to (re)render the page after a button has been clicked

### Built with
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
